\section{Project Issues}

    	\subsection{Open Issues}
        \textcolor{red}{The following information outlines issues that have been raised, but have yet to be resolved:\\}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item [iss.1:] \textcolor{red}{The back-end infrastructure that the team plans to use (firebase) does not allow many custom data handling features such as encryption, complex queries
                            etc.\\ This is not a important issue since the
                            users' who might share sensitive information might be the only customers that will be affected
                            in the unlikely case that the server would be accessed without appropriate authorization. 
                            Express server with web-socket communication will be considered and evaluated if the issues severely impacts security or any other concerns.}

            \item [iss.2] \textcolor{red}{The team also plans to use firebase authentication to handle sign in and sign ups.
                            This is convenient but limits certain profile customization features
                            like changing name, adding profile picture etc.
                            This issue should not affect the usability/functionality of the application.
                            Non-functional requirements such as customization might be affected.
                            The team will research other services that allows greater user customization.}  
        \end{enumerate}

    	\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
		\textcolor{red}{Currently, there are many solutions that occupy the market of online web communication}.	
	    	
    	\begin{enumerate}
    	    \item Tinode Messenger: \textcolor{red}{This product is a free to use open source web-app for chatting that acts as a model for our current implementation of Node Messenger. It features a minimal user interface with basic one-on-one messaging and group chat conversations. Users create a custom profile with an uploaded profile picture and set tags for discovery.}
    	    \item Facebook Messenger: \textcolor{red}{This product is created to compliment the Facebook by connecting all their users and allowing them to communicate. The product implements many features such as file transmission, group chat creation and providing the user a lot of control over their experience. The app can be accessed through the Facebook domain and is cross platform.}
    	    \item \textcolor{red}{WhatsApp Messenger: This product has a web-app element that functions off the mobile app. However, it is a well received application praised for its simplicity in group chat creation and management along with connecting a plethora of users through telephone numbers.}
    	\end{enumerate}

    	\subsection{New Problems}
    	Node Messenger will occupy just one of the many web addresses being hosted. It should not create any problems, unless the website cannot hold a large amount of people at a time. The product will not have any effect on the installed systems, as nothing is required to be downloaded to be used. Node Messenger might cause problems for the users if used for a prolonged period of time, such as hand pain, or eye soreness. 

    	\subsection{Tasks}
    	\begin{center}
    		\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
    		\hline 
    		\textbf{Task} & \textbf{Completer's Role} & \textbf{Timeline} \\

    		Model Implementation & Software Engineer & Oct 10th \\ 
    		\hline 
    		Model Revision & Client & Oct 14th \\

    		\hline 
    		Maintenance & Software Engineers & Yearly \\ 
    		\hline 
    	\end{tabular} 
    	\end{center}
		Task 1: Create a model of the Node Messenger website to visualize how everything will be positioned. This will help to understand how everything in our website will interact with each other.\\
		Task 2: Create the front-end of the website using HTML and CSS. Ensure the website is clean and visually appealing.\\
		Task 3: Create the back-end of the website using Javascript. Ensure all components of the messenger is fully functioning and creates the desired output. Task 4: Host the messaging app on a free web hosting site.

    	\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
    	Not Applicable.

    	\subsection{Risks}
    	\textcolor{red}{Risks are inherent in the development of any product. The following information highlights possible risks for this project: \\}
    	
    	\begin{itemize}
    		\item \textcolor{red}{Server Overload}
    		\item \textcolor{red}{Privacy Invasion}
    		\item \textcolor{red}{Inaccurate Data Rendering}
    		\item \textcolor{red}{Bad Programming Practices}
    		\item \textcolor{red}{Complex Project Scope}
    		\item \textcolor{red}{Over-estimated Project Size}
    		\item \textcolor{red}{Loss of Resources}
    		\item \textcolor{red}{Incomplete Documentation}
    		\item \textcolor{red}{Testing Difficulties}
    	\end{itemize}

    	\subsection{Costs}
    \textcolor{red}{Monetary costs for this project have been constrained to \$0 which is achievable with free web-hosting. High labour costs are evoked from the considerable amount of work hours required for the software's development. Team members must be able and willing to commit approximately 7 hours per week to complete their designated tasks. Resource costs also remain low with the assumption all development tools and software used such as \textbf{React Semantics} assets and \textbf{Firebase} remain free of charge.}
    	
    	\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
    	\textcolor{red}{With the assumption that the consumer of this software is familiar with using web-messaging applications, the team plans to minimize user documentation as the product is required to be simple and intuitive to use. However, it is understood that with future additions and updates, the product may become more complex. Should the need arise, the team will compile a user documentation intended to assist all clients and consumers with effectively operating our software.}\\
    	
    	\textcolor{red}{User document contents:}\\
    	\begin{itemize}
    
    		\item \textcolor{red}{User Manual}
    		\item \textcolor{red}{Help Section}
    	\end{itemize}

    	\subsection{Waiting Room}
   	\textcolor{red}{The following are features that the team wishes to implement in the future development of this project:}\\
   	
   	\begin{itemize}
   		\item \textcolor{red}{Notifications: An important component of any online messaging system is inform the user of updates and events centered around the application. Whether it is alerts to new messages or an indicator for total unread conversations, this feature would greatly improve the usability of our product. This feature would be developed as an update to the final release of the product.}
   		\item \textcolor{red}{Profile Customization: The ability for the user to customize their profile helps gives them a distinct identity within our application and invest them in using it. Allowing the user to modify their profile information such as display name, phone number or profile picture would provide more search tag options for discovering users and therefore expand our user base. This feature would likely be incorporated in a Version 2 product update.}
   		\item \textcolor{red}{Group Controls: This feature would allow the user to administer group chats by adding or removing members, modifying group name and picture and even leave the group if desired. This is essential in group conversation programs that gives our product greater flexibility and functionality. Such a feature would be implemented in a Version 2 product update.}
   	\end{itemize}

    	\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}

	\textcolor{red}{The following is a purposed solution to some of the outlined requirements that would be implemented through the back-end portion of the program.}\\  	
    	
    \textcolor{red}{Firebase Database: Utilizing Firebase for our back-end instead of socket.io can give us greater flexibility with our web-app as it allows us to properly structure the database and choose what information to store. The database can be built to store user information for authentication, messages and conversations with the use of specific fields and keys for better data communication while still retaining real time connection of socket.io.}

\section{General Information}


\subsection{Purpose}
This purpose of this document is to outline areas of testing from tools to methodology and plan that will verify both functional and non-functional requirements of the product and ensure that we are delivering a valid product to our clients designed in accordance to the outlined requirements.
\subsection{Scope}
As this is web-messenger product, testing will be focused on elements that are integral for mobile communication. Test plan shall cover both front-end and back-end implementations of functions to ensure validity. Front-end testing will consist of user input and output correction as well and proper rendering. Back-end testing will ensure that proper input and output collection is correct as well as user authentication, data transfer and stress testing firebase database system. If the product passes all the tests outlined in this document, it will be considered a valid implementation of the requirements outlined in the SRS document.

\subsection{Overview of Document}
This document will outline a proper test plan for functional and non-functional requirement as well as tests for our current proof of concept demonstration. The document will also break down the testing process into multiple divided section and elaborating on them in great detail to provide context to our testing methodologies. Finally this implementation of the product will be compared to a successful one based on a list of usability questions and through this an outlined unit test plan will be formed. Any abstract symbols can be explored in the attached appendix for clarification on any unclear document elements.
\section{Plan}
	
\subsection{Software Description}
The software is a fully functioning web-app that allows users to communicate with each other through messages. The users are able to create an account using their preferred email address and specified display name and password. Once they are clients of Node Messenger, they are able to utilize its messaging features. The web-page displays a list of previous conversations and selected ones. Users can initiate conversations with other Node Messenger clients and converse through messages in a local chat window. All conversation information is stored and rendered for the user in constant time to create a seamless and naturally flowing dialogue.

\subsection{Test Team}
The test team consists of all three members of the development team: Tasin Ahmed, Shardool Patel, and Omar Elemary. The testing process will be divided into both front-end and back-end testing. Each member is responsible for conducting unit tests for each developed components to ensure proper functionality. The team will then begin integration testing once all modules are complete to examine the system working as a whole and additionally perform a system test to verify that all outlined functional and non-functional requirements of the product are successfully met.

\subsection{Automated Testing Approach}

The team plans to automate most of the testing using two frameworks: Jest and Mocha. UI components will be tested based on the snapshot testing approach that jest implements, allowing us to see if things are rendered accurately. Everything other than the UI will be unit tested on mocha. Independent functionality features as well as some non-function requirements such as performance will be tested using unit tests. 

\subsection{Testing Tools}
We will be utilizing Jest in order to test React our code, and Mocha to test Javascript. This will be done in order to keep bugs to a minimum, and to better the user experience. There will be a sections on our website where users can leave their reviews, and suggestions to improve our product.

\subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Requirements}

\section{Tests for Proof of Concept}

The purpose of the proof of concept was to demonstrate the general functionality of a chat application. It included login/signup and real-time chat built within a simple user interface. Therefore, the tests for proof will include the all the tests from sections: 3.1.1 Authentication, 3.1.2 Chat Input/Output and 3.2.1 Performance and 3.2.4 Portability.


	
\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}	
Node Messenger is based upon Tinode, an existing implantation of a web messaging app. Tinode implements a successful messaging app with the inclusion of 3 main functions: Correct display of messages being sent and received, displays a list of past messages with other users, and stores the messages of a user, allowing them to logout or login with a different account. We will be testing to see if the messages being sent, and the messages being received are formatted properly, and they display on the correct side of the screen. Node Messenger will also be tested to ensure it can create different messaging rooms to let the user chat with other users flawlessly. We will be creating multiple accounts to test if Node Messenger is able to store, access, and show data specific to each user.  
				
\section{Unit Testing Plan}
We will be using Jest, and Mocha to test the functions governing Node Messenger. We will be ensure that the functions carry out their task properly and return their expected output.  Messages should display properly if it is entered correctly, e.g. if a blank message is entered, it must not send an empty message to the message box. Our group will try to cover as much ground as possible in order to ensure a better user experience. 
		
\subsection{Unit testing of internal functions}
Unit testing using Jest will be mainly used for testing internal functions in Node Messenger. We will be testing the functions above, as well as other key internal functions to ensure Node Messenger functions as expected. Unit testing these internal functions will help us to determine hidden errors, or loopholes in the code that cannot be easily spotted.

\subsection{Unit testing of output files}

=======
        As the world becomes increasingly more connected through the internet, many common internet users are looking for an easy way to communicate with each other or reach out to distant loved ones. The market for messengers has become saturated with products that put the goal of earning maximum revenue over the needs of the consumer. Our teamâ€™s focus is to gauge consumer interest by implementing a free and accessible web application messenger that allows them to personalize their experience and chat with other users in a simple, clean and non-intrusive way. Node messenger will become a haven for users searching for a consumer-friendly product with great functionality and cross-platform support.
    	\subsection{The Stakeholders}

    		\subsubsection{The Client}
            The client for Node Messenger would be the same as the end user since Node Messenger is a general purpose app designed to serve anyone with access to internet.
    		\subsubsection{The Customers}
    		Node messenger will serve as a general purpose chat application that also supports group chats. The customers for Node messenger will be - the people who want to connect with friends and family, various discussion groups and collaborative teams.


    		\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}
    		 Other stakeholders included the development team and future developers who might want to build upon this open source project.

\section{General Information}


\subsection{Purpose}
This purpose of this document is to outline areas of testing from tools to methodology and plan that will verify both functional and non-functional requirements of the product and ensure that we are delivering a valid product to our clients designed in accordance to the outlined requirements.
\subsection{Scope}
As this is web-messenger product, testing will be focused on elements that are integral for mobile communication. Test plan shall cover both front-end and back-end implementations of functions to ensure validity. Front-end testing will consist of user input and output correction as well and proper rendering. Back-end testing will ensure that proper input and output collection is correct as well as user authentication, data transfer and stress testing firebase database system. If the product passes all the tests outlined in this document, it will be considered a valid implementation of the requirements outlined in the SRS document.

\subsection{Overview of Document}
This document will outline a proper test plan for functional and non-functional requirement as well as tests for our current proof of concept demonstration. The document will also break down the testing process into multiple divided section and elaborating on them in great detail to provide context to our testing methodologies. Finally this implementation of the product will be compared to a successful one based on a list of usability questions and through this an outlined unit test plan will be formed. Any abstract symbols can be explored in the attached appendix for clarification on any unclear document elements.

\section{Appendix}

This is where you can place additional information.

\subsection{Symbolic Parameters}

The definition of the test cases will call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS.
Their values are defined in this section for easy maintenance.

\subsection{Usability Survey Questions?}

This is a section that would be appropriate for some teams.
